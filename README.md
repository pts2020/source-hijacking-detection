# Source Hijacking Detection

Source Hijacking Detection is a real-time hijacking detecting system based on MOAS (Multi-Origin Autonomous System) event. It monitors real-time MOAS events in the global BGP routing table and uses domain knowledge, including information from Whois, ROA (Route Origin Authorization), AS (Autonomous System) relationships, etc., along with predefined rules, to filter out benign events and identify potential hijacking events. The project uses producer-consumer architecture, the producer gets route data, which are from BGP route feeds, such as RIPE RIS, RouteViews, our CGTF RIS ([Index of / (cgtf.net)](https://bgp.cgtf.net/)), and the consumer processes route, and monitors BGP hijacking events, then saves the data to database. Source Hijacking Detection is only for hijacking detecting, if you want a web-system with frontend info, please refer to bgpwatch-frontend and bgpwatch-backend files.

The BGPWatch platform has been developed by researchers and engineers from 19 countries/economies and funded by APNIC Foundation and the Chinese Government. The platform is accessible to the public at https://bgpwatch.cgtf.net.

The platform supports BGP hijack detection, ensures swift response times, sends event warnings via email, assesses the severity of events, and provides event replay capabilities, which are all designed to effectively assist network operators. 

Additionally, the platform has developed various tools useful for network operators to monitor the network, including a dashboard displaying the key AS information, showing forward, reverse and bi-directional routing path.

# Requirements

You need to setup a kafka message queue as proxy, a database for hijacking storage, and have python3.8 installed. 



# Installing and running
### install python packages

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements
```


### modify config file
Modify example/example_config.json as you see fit.

```json
{

"forever_start_datetime": "Start datetime",
"mail_pass": "email password",
"server_name": "Server Name",
"load_ongoing_data": "Whether use ongoing file",
"use_local_files": "Whether use local file",
"log_level": "Log level",
"admin_email": "The email of Administer",
"roa_url": "ROA URL",
"bgpwatch_url": "BGPWATCH URL",
"tmp_name": "TEMP data save path",
"db_config": "DB info",
"kafka_config": "Kafka info"
}
```

### Start Producer

```shell
tmux 
python3 TSU-BGPMonitor-Producer/main.py
```

### Start Consumer

```shell
tmux 
python3 TSU-BGPMonitor-Consumer/main.py
```

### Output Event format
```javascript
{
    "hash_0" : "0", 								# Partition key of kafka
    "event_id" : "168.253.248.0/24-moas1701388889", 				# Event id

        "168.253.255.0/24-moas1701388889"
    ],
    "prefix_list" : [ 								# Aggregated event prefix
        "168.253.248.0/24", 
        "168.253.255.0/24"
    ],
    "websites" : {								# The websites relation to prefix
